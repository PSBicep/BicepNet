# BicepNet

This is the repository for **BicepNet**, a thin wrapper around [Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) that will load all Bicep assemblies in a separate context to avoid conflicts with other modules. **BicepNet** is developed for the [Bicep PowerShell](https://github.com/PSBicep/BicepPowerShell) module but could be used for any other project where you want to leverage Bicep functionality in PowerShell.
